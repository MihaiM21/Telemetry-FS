### Telemetry scripts for formula student BUT can be used on any other type of cars

These scripts needs 2 raspberry pi's (one on the car and one around the circuit/place set up as an access point).

Both the raspberry pi from the car and the laptops/phones from members/people needs to be connected to the  access point to acces the data from the car.

The data is sent encrypted for less mmemory use and efficiency.

The client.py is working as intended but an UI is still in development.
